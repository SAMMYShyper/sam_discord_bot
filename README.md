# sam_discord_bot
This is my discord bot. Inspired by Indently, FreeCodeCamp, and other sources. Currently contains funny features (affirmations, quotes, coin flips, !help) and OpenAi's Turbo GPT API, but likely outdated. If needed to upgrade, just run !ai on discord (when bot is running) and a github repo will appear containing info for updating the model.
